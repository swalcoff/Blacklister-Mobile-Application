# Blacklister Mobile Application

This is the mobile application side of Blacklister. This application allows you to choose which websites the desktop/laptop user is allowed to access. If you'd like to view the desktop application, you can follow this link: https://github.com/swalcoff/Blacklister-Java-Application

## Getting Started

In order to run, open an Android Studio virtual mobile device (optimized for Google Pixel 3), run application, and login or signup. Once inside your account, type in a website that you'd like to blacklist. To remove a website from the blacklist, press and hold the website tile until it disappears.
